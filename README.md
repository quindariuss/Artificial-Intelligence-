## Description
The primary objective of this course is to provide a introduction to the basic principles and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It covers the basic areas of AI including problem solving, knowledge representation, reasoning, decision making, planning, perception and action, and learning -- and their applications. Students will design and implement key components of intelligent agents of modern complexity and evaluate their performance. Students are expected to develop familiarity with current research problems, research methods, and the research literature in AI.

## Learning Objectives 
- Demonstrate understanding knowledge of AI knowledge representation.
- Demonstrate understanding of advanced search and reasoning algorithms
- Design an AI system with Lisp or Prolog for problem solving.
